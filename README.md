# CourseWork-Java-C
McMaster Coursework for COMPENG 2SH4 and COMPENG 2SI4

Includes Programming Exercises,labs and exam question solutions in Java and C. 

## Labs 

### HugeInteger-Java Class
Is ablle to represent arbitrary large integer numbers. Implementation of arithmetic operations on large integers. A string of a very large number is converted to an array of digits and then preforms the specified operation:
* Addition: add two huge integers using long addition.
* Subtraction: subtract two integers using long subtraction.
* CompareTo: compare two large integers to determine the bigger integer with signs.
* Multiplication: using the karatsuba algorithm (recursive and base case is multiplying two one-digit numbers).

* Run time for the code is:

$$ T(n) = \{\theta(n)} $$

### Implementation-of-Sets-using-LinkedLists
Implement sets of integers using singly linked lists. The elements in the set must be stored in a singly linked list in increasing order. The java class will always be sorted after each method:
* Determine if the integer is in the set
* Add an integer to the set
* Remove an integer from the set.
* Taking the union of two sets (Set A u Set B)
* Taking the intersection of two sets (Set A n Set B)
* Combining two sets with common integers.

### Matrix-Integer-Arithmetic-Functions-java
Two Java Classes that will return arrays after preforming different 2D array operations.
* Matrix: represents matrices with integer elements
	* add two matrices
	* subtract two matrices
	* checks if it is upper triangular
* Upper Trianguler Matrix: represent upper triangular matrices with integer elements stored efficiently
	* get the determinant of the matrix
	* Solve the matrix (Ax=B)
